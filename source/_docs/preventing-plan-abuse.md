## How We Measure Site Traffic

Pantheon defines plan levels based on pageviews to help site owners pick the right plan based on expected or historical traffic. To prevent plan abuse, we measure requests served by the platform from the CMS. 

This includes not only HTML pages, but also responses in formats such as JSON and XML that are sometimes not tracked by standard analytics suites. API calls count as traffic, and are considered part of a site's plan limit.

## Does Pantheon Charge for Overages?

Pantheon takes site plan abuse seriously, but we recognize that sometimes these situations are complicated. We always start with a conversation. If you are surprised by a notification of possible abuse, our team is ready, willing, and able to dig into the inevitable differences between our measurements of traffic served and any other analytics you may have.

There is no mechanical "overage" process that will surprise you with a shock bill for something that happened in the past. However, where there is a pattern of consistent overage, we will seek to align site plans to their load on the platform going forward. We reserve the right to terminate service for abusers who are unwilling to use an appropriate plan.

## Why Doesn't Pantheon's Traffic Match My Analytics?

There are some inherent limitations with using an analytics suite (e.g. Google Analytics) when measuring site traffic:

 - Browsers/users that block cookies and javascript is not counted.
 - Users that close the browser before the tracking script loads are not counted.
 - Any page with a JavaScript error is not counted.
 - Automated traffic from bots or load testing is not counted.
 - API requests and AJAX requests are not counted.
 - Analytics implementations can be variable and may (for good reason) not include all pages on a given website.

Due to the fact that analytics doesn't measure _traffic_, it's not a suitable metric to for determining platform abuse.

## What About Static Assets?

Static requests (images PDFs, CSS, JS, etc) are not included in our normal traffic metrics. Under regular CMS use-cases, these supporting requests to render HTML pages for users with browsers are not a concern.

However we do reserve the right to review individual sites that are excessive bandwidth consumers. If sites are serving static assets at an excessive rate, this can be considered plan abuse.

## What About Bots?

Pantheon makes a serous effort to exclude automated traffic from crawlers and bots that would otherwise count towards your website's total traffic because they place load on the platform. We do this by examining the user-agent of traffic, as well as the source IP address.

We respect that you cannot control this kind of traffic, and that crawler traffic is _beneficial_ to sites. We are continually refining our model to ensure our traffic reports are as accurate as possible. We do not consider legitimate white-hat bot traffic a sign of plan abuse.

## What About Load Tests or Pen Tests?

Our onboarding team performs load tests prior to every Elite site launch, and we encourage customers to load test prior to releasing a big update. We also fully support customers who want to penetration test their site, which can result in significant spikes in traffic.

However, if you are load or pen testing in extreme excess of your plan limits, or do so on a regular and repeated basis, we reserve the right to charge for a plan that is appropriate to the load placed on the platform. This is one of the reasons we ask customers to notify us of such tests as a courtesy. 

## What About Legit Traffic Spikes?

We understand that the internet can make any website famous overnight, and that this isn't under your control. Pantheon's platform is specifically designed to shine in this circumstance, and it's one of the main reasons people choose us to run their sites. 

Luckily, traffic spikes are easily discerned, and we take this into account when it comes to monitoring plan abuse. However, similar to the above, if a site is achieving internet fame on a regular basis, we reserve the right to right-size the site's plan in relation to the load it puts on the platform. 

## What About Denial of Service and Other Attacks?

We are well aware that malignant actors can create a ton of traffic out of nowhere, and that this is not a fair measure of what a customer should pay for. We are more than willing to investigate a discrepancy between our traffic measurements and other site analytics on a case by case basis.

As above, in cases where these events are regular or sustained, we reserve the right to right-size a site plan. If a site's real load on the platform is consistently higher than what appears in end-user analytics, fairness demands that the site plan fit its usage.

## Let's Talk

Site traffic is rarely a black and white issue, and cases of clear plan abuse are outliers. We always start with a conversation, and are equipped to go deep in determining what is causing an excessive amount of traffic for your site.

If you receive a communication from us about possible plan abuse, don't panic. We will work with you to fully understand the situation and find a solution, whether that involves shutting down a malicious bot, or adjusting your site's plan.
